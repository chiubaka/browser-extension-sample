This project is a sample that serves as a template for creating a cross-platform compatible browser
extension using React, TypeScript and modern tooling.

This project should meet the following requirements:
- As much of the codebase as possible is written in TypeScript
  - Proper typings are used or created for underlying browser APIs
- View components are built using React
- One codebase builds a functional Chrome Extension, Firefox Extension, and Safari Extension
- Uses NPM for dependency management
- Functional E2E testing
- Unit testing with Jest
- Integrates Sentry for error reporting
- Integrates Google Analytics for usage analysis

Additionally, this template is meant to eventually be generated entirely by [`genesis`](https://github.com/chiubaka/genesis).

This monorepo was generated by the Chiubaka Technologies `genesis` CLI.
